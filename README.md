# Monotone operator equilibrium networks

Repository to hold the code of final project of Course "Optimization Methods for Machine Learning". The code is based on the original forked [repository](https://github.com/locuslab/monotone_op_net).


**See the [tutorial notebook](tutorial.ipynb) for an introduction to the original paper and the code in this repo.**

Code to replicate the experiments can be found in [`experiments.ipynb`](experiments.ipynb). 

## Requirements
Compatible with python 3.5+ and known to work with pytorch 1.4, torchvision 0.5, and numpy 1.18. Can install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
